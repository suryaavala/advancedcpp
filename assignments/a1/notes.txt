Write a stack-based calculator program in C++. The calculator reads tokens (numbers and commands) from a specified input file. In the input file each token is separated by a space or a new line. Each number is placed on a stack and each command consumes one or more values from the stack. A command may result in a modification of the stack, an additional number added to the stack, and/or output printed to the console (stdout / cout). The calculator should support int and double values and only promote an int to a double when necessary. Your program should be written in pure C++ (not C) and should make use of the C++ STL. When printing output your double values should be formatted to three decimal places
